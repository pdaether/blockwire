# 🧱 BlockWire

The reactive, drag-and-drop block editor for the TALL stack.
BlockWire is a powerful, developer-friendly CMS-like editor built specifically for Laravel and Livewire. It allows you to build complex, modular content layouts using a "drag-and-drop" interface that feels native to your application.

## Why BlockWire?

* Built for the TALL Stack: Native support for Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Livewire, and Laravel.
* Component-Based: Every block is a Livewire component. If you can build a component, you can build a block.
* Intuitive Drag & Drop: A smooth, modern UI that allows non-technical users to build professional layouts.
* Fully Customizable: Total control over the look and feel. No "forced" styles that you have to fight against.
* Laravel Native: Uses your existing Eloquent models, policies, and storage disks.
